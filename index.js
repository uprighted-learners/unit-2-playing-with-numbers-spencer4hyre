//Math in JS uses the Pemdas order of operations, however it will not add 1 to an exponent because it views its value as 0. It outputs decimals and exponents down to every placeholder. It is not capable of quantum computing, thus if you subtract ∞ from ∞ or divide by 0, you're output will be NaN or "not a number".
